## Why Akos?

Before being able to make a living from their passion, **indie game developers** usually start developing in their spare time, alongside a full-time job.

Under these conditions, they quickly run out of a valuable resource that is impossible to capitalize on: **time**.

Time needed to learn all the required skills to make a professional quality video game can be a source of discouragement for many creators. Akos has been designed to drastically reduce this time by **eliminating coding**, which is one of the most difficult game dev skills to master.

In this way, we hope to help novice game devs focus their creativity and **stay motivated** throughout their project.
