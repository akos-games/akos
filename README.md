## Why Akos?

Before being able to make a living from their passion, **indie game developers** usually start developing in their spare time, alongside a full-time job.

Under these conditions, they quickly run out of a valuable resource that is impossible to capitalize on: **time**.

Time needed to learn all the required skills to make a professional quality video game can be a source of discouragement for many creators. Akos has been designed to drastically reduce this time by **eliminating coding**, which is one of the most difficult game dev skills to master.

In this way, we hope to motivate novice game devs to get started by focusing on what is most important in any creative endeavor: **creativity**.
