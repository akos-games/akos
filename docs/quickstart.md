# Quickstart

## Download

Download the [latest stable version](https://github.com/grimwred/akos/releases).

Extract it and run the `Akos Editor` executable file.

## Create game project

From the welcome page or from the top left menu, click on `Create Project`.

Choose your project file location. It is recommended to create a subfolder for your project.

## Create a scene

To create your first scene, click on the plus `+` button next to the `Scenes` item in the left sidebar.

On the scene page, enter a scene name and then click the `Add command` button.

Check the `Wait for player click to continue` box then enter some text in the field below.

## Define game properties

Come back to the game properties page and set all the required fields (marked with an asterisk `*`).

## Build and run your game

Click on the `Build game` button in the top toolbar.

Now open your file explorer and find your project file. You will notice a `dist` folder next to it, which contains your game deliverable.

Find game executable file and run it!
